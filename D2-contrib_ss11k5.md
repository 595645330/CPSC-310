1.  final test pass rate: 96% line coverage rate: 96% 

2.  I wrote the check function in the helper function, part of the parsing html functions in helper, and I made all the
    changes to our EQ,GT,IS.. functions.
    I also wrote the error handling cases, so that our code can reject 400 and 424 errors. And I worked on the 
    unit tests to make our line coverage 100%.
    
3.  My partner made all the commits because we had merge error before. We decided to move all the code to his computer,
    so that merge error will not happen again.
    I have committed our unit test once though:
    https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team80/commit/80b9a9f4f003ebbec6eb768c8a4dc1d10673a3b5
    
4.  I think D2 went pretty well. We just could not figure out why there are 2 failing tests when we run Autotest.

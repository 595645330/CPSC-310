final test pass rate: 100% line coverage rate: 96% Grade: 100%

I made all the changes in server to handle http requests. I also wrote the unit tests and made line coverage 96%

My partner made most of the commits because we had merge error before. We decided to move all the code to his computer, so that merge error will not happen again.
Here are some of my commits:
